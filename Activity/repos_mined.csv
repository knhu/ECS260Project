* removed Cypress

* installed Playwright and @axe-core/playwright w/ Yarn

* Enhance Playwright integration and configuration for testing environments

- Updated .gitignore to exclude Playwright generated directories and cache for cleaner commits.
- Modified package.json to include new scripts for running Playwright tests in local and production environments and added necessary dependencies for testing.
- Revised the Playwright configuration in playwright.config.ts to define environment-specific base URLs and expanded browser coverage to include Edge, mobile browsers, and iPad.
- Added TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json to recognize Playwright types.
- Established new directories for component objects and fixtures to better organize test components and utilities.
- Introduced abstract base classes for page objects and component objects to standardize interaction with Playwright's Page object.
- Created specific test cases in landing-page.spec.ts to validate functionality of the landing page, ensuring visibility of essential elements and correct page responses.
- Overall enhancements to the testing infrastructure to support a more robust and scalable testing framework.

* removed 'frontend/.gitignore'

* redid 'yarn install' for new yarn.lock file

* Refactor and enhance testing configuration for accessibility and consistency

- Update Playwright config to explicitly set mobile devices in the testing environment to improve clarity and ensure mobile-specific behaviors are accurately tested.
- Modify the LandingPage class to use a centralized locators object, streamlining the management of page element selectors and facilitating future updates.
- Introduce an accessibility test using AxeBuilder to ensure the landing page adheres to specified WCAG standards, though this test is initially skipped to allow for further adjustments.
- Enhance the landing page test suite to include a new test verifying the visibility of all critical links, ensuring key page elements are functional and correctly displayed.
- Adjust import statements in test specs to align with the updated structure and improve test setup clarity.

These changes aim to make the test suite more maintainable and robust, particularly regarding accessibility standards and mobile responsiveness.

* feat: Added tests for Group model

Added following tests for Group model:
- Group Creation: Tests successful creation, missing required fields, and invalid data.
- Group Update: Tests successful update and handling of invalid input.
- Group Deletion: Tests successful deletion and an attempt to delete a non-existent group.

* test(group): Add comprehensive Group model validation tests

- Add test_group_creation to validate complete Group object creation
- Add test_required_fields to ensure validation for mandatory fields
- Add test_optional_fields to verify handling of optional fields

This commit introduces three unit tests for the Group model:
1. Validates full object creation with all fields
2. Checks validation errors for missing required fields
3. Confirms optional fields can be blank/null

* test: add Group model validation and cascade delete tests

Add tests to verify:
- Maximum length constraints for Group model fields
- Cascade deletion behavior when parent Organization or User is deleted

* test: Add comprehensive test coverage for Group models

- Add test cases for GroupMember model covering roles and membership
- Add test cases for GroupResource model with creation and deletion flows
- Add test cases for GroupText model including language handling
- Add test cases for GroupTopic model with relationship validations
- Add test cases for GroupEvent model with multiple event relation
- Expand Group model tests with field validations and cascade deletions

The test suite now validates:
- Model relationships and constraints
- Field validations and max lengths
- Multi-language support for text content
- Cascade deletion behavior
- Required vs optional field handling
