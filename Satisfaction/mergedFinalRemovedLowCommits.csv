way of the official pyrax SDK (https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax). At
this time only the cloudservers service is functional. Instances can be
created or deleted. Idempotency is provided on matching instances with
the same name, flavor, image, and metadata values within a given
region.

and API key.  See pyrax documentation for details

Both python-json and simplejson always return unicode strings when using
their loads() method on unicode strings. This is true at least since

need to recursively check the strings contained in the inventory dict

ansible,Yanis Guenane,2016-12-08 16:35:03+00:00,"network: Add new module openssl_privatekey

This module aims to allow a user to manage the lifecycle of OpenSSL
private keys. Internally it relies on the pyOpenSSL python library
to interact with openssl.

A user is able to specify :

  * key size (via `size` parameter)
  * key algorithm (via `type` parameter)
  * key location (via `path` parameter)

The most simple use case is:

```
- name: Generate ansible.com.pem SSL private key
  openssl_privatekey: name=ansible.com.pem
                      path=/etc/ssl/private
```

A user can speficy more settings:

```
- name: Generate ansible.com.pem SSL private key
  openssl_privatekey: name=ansible.com.pem
                      path=/etc/ssl/private
                      size=2048
                      type=DSA
```

A user can also force the regeneration of an SSL key:

```
- name: Generate ansible.com.pem SSL private key
  openssl_privatekey: name=ansible.com.pem
                      path=/etc/ssl/private

was getting invalid keys from paramiko. It looks like this is because
ssh-keygen is now defaulting to RFC4716 format for private / public
keys.

For now, we can still use PEM based SSH keys, but the long term fix here
is to report a bug to paramiko and support RFC4716 for rsa keys.

ansible,Rick Elrod,2020-01-29 21:29:40+00:00,"Remove `with` statement for pytest-mock unit tests

As per:
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock#note-about-usage-as-context-manager
pytest-mock is not meant to be used within a `with` context or as a
decorator. Instead, pytest-mock will automatically unpatch the mocked
methods when each test is complete.

In newer pytest-mock, this use actually throws an exception and causes
the tests to fail.

This hasn't been hit in Ansible's CI yet, because the docker image
that the tests run in uses an older version of pytest-mock. However,
there is no constraint on the upper bound of pytest-mock in
test/lib/ansible_test/_data/requirements/constraints.txt which means
that when running the tests locally, outside of that docker image, the
tests never pass.

This patch removes the `with` context in each such case.

Before it was not possible to set all rcParams to mpl.rcParams or use

There were two problems:
 1. validate_bool_maybe_none(None) was raising ValueError
 -> fixed by accepting this value
 2. svg.embed_char_paths was deprecated by svg.fonttype but both have
 different valid values (bool vs strings).
 -> fixed by adding a ""value translation"" lambda to deprecatedmap
 which translates the boolean values to the string values of
 svg.fonttype.

Add nightlies.yml GitHub Action workflow that uses the gh CLI API to
download the 'wheels' artifact from the latest completed build of the
cibuildwheel workflow from the 'main' branch. This is done by getting
the fields 'event', 'status', and 'databaseId' from the output of
`gh run list` as JSON and then using jq to filter for 'push' events
(which correspond to merged PRs to the 'main' branch) that have
completed runs. This is then sorted by the databaseIds in descending
order to get the latest completed build run number. Then the 'wheels'
artifact can be downloaded.

The downloaded wheels are then uploaded to the scipy-wheels-nightly
Anaconda Cloud organization (https://anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly)

mitmproxy,Gaurav Jain,2024-02-27 11:50:25+00:00,"Add `content_view_lines_cutoff` option to mitmdump (#6692)

#### Description

Fixes #4476 
This PR adds the already existing `content_view_lines_cutoff` option to
`mitmdump` to filter the number of content lines shown when
`flow_detail` option is set to `3`. By default this option's value is
set to `512`

Updated tests that check for `cutoff` in responses that cross `512`
lines(with the default value set)
Added tests to ensure that custom values for `content_view_lines_cutoff`
works as intended

#### Verification
1. run `mitmdump --set flow_detail=3 --set content_view_lines_cutoff=3`
2. run `curl --proxy http:/127.0.0.1:8080 ""https://google.com/""`

While discussing the Flatpak RFC [1], it was spotted that the
LUT filter couldn't open the file selection dialog. It was
explained, then, that the proper formats were either composed
of ""User Label (file extensions)"", or ""file extensions"", and
the LUT filter was setting ""(file extensions)"" without the
actual user label.

While this works on a standard Qt file selection dialog, it
cannot be properly formatted as a set of D-Bus filters, thus
breaking the sandbox integration.

Add a simple user label to the LUT file filter.

List<? super String>.isAssignableFrom(List<Object>) == true // Correct
<? super CharSequence>.isAssignableFrom(String) == false // Wrong!
<? super String>.isAssignableFrom(<Object>) == true // Wrong! Not assignable

To show why they are wrong, consider the following three code snippets where the first two compile and the third doesn't compile:

void okay(Receiver<List<? super String>> receiver, List<Object> objects) {
receiver.accept(objects);
}

void okay2(Receiver<? super CharSequence> receiver) {
receiver.accept(""1"");

ocaml,Marc Lasson,2015-11-20 16:37:45+00:00,"Fix memory leaks in intern.c when OOM is raised

In the function, `intern_alloc` a call to caml_alloc_for_heap is very likely to
return NULL when reading a big marshaled value. If that happens, before raising
out_of_memory, it should call the `intern_cleanup` function to free the stack
as well as `intern_input` that may have been malloced by `caml_input_val`.
Similarly, `intern_cleanup` should also be called when we are not able to
allocate `intern_obj_table`. To do that, I added a function
`caml_stat_alloc_no_raise` which, like its brother, `caml_stat_alloc` wraps
some debugging information around a call to malloc. I could have used directly
malloc instead of adding a new function to memory.c, as it is done in other
places of the code (it has the drawback of not adding the debug tag).

Note that this fix is not perfect. The function `intern_alloc` could also raise
out_of_memory through its call to `caml_alloc_shr`. It is less likely to happen
since caml_alloc_shr is only called when the input is smaller than Max_wosize
but it could happen. In that case, there will be leak (but a smaller one).",https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml,22,2015-11-20 15:37:45-01:00,87.33333333333333,29.83983572895277,28,neutral,35.714285714285715

The docs on this are out of date: they say runtime warnings are enabled by
default, but the source code has a commit 6c90da4 pointing to
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/210 that disables them by default.

It seems like enabling runtime warnings by default never made its way into a
release and the docs could just be updated to say that runtime warnings are
disabled by default.

ocaml,Samuel Hym,2023-04-28 16:06:02+00:00,"Improve legibility of dynamic linking error messages

Avoid wrapping a Dynlink `Cannot_open_dynamic_library` error into
another `Cannot_open_dynamic_library` error:
- rewrite the platform-specific (bytecode and native) `load`
  implementations to ensure they raise only `DT.Error` exceptions, by
  always catching other exceptions and wrapping them into
  `Cannot_open_dynamic_library` errors,
- remove the systematic wrapping of exceptions in `Dynlink_common`.

Adopt `%s` rather than `%S` to display the inner exceptions in the
exception printer for `DT.Error (Cannot_open_dynamic_library _)` to
avoid double escaping

In particular, trying to link a non-existent file in the native
implementation gives the hard-to-parse message:

  Fatal error: exception Dynlink.Error (Dynlink.Cannot_open_dll ""Dynlink.Error (Dynlink.Cannot_open_dll \""Failure(\\\""...: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\\\"")\"")"")

* Throw error if user tries to ignore a staff member

Throws a UserCannotBeIgnoredError if a user tries to ignore

considered anyone who has a role of staff, moderator, or admin.

CORL-409

* Prevent users from ignoring staff in the user info popover

Creates the staff roles in a constant next to the user model.
Uses this to add a computed property to the user resolver.

CORL-409

* Remove unnecessary async declaration from userIsStaff helper function

CORL-409

* Specify ignoreable on users in client test fixtures

Allows the tests to pass for the required computed property
of ignoreable that is computed by whether a user is a staff
member or not.

CORL-409

* Update more fixtures with ignoreable property on mocked users/commenters

CORL-409

* Consolidate ignore-able calculation into re-usable helper methods

Re-use the logic for whether a role is a staff member to
clearly define when a user is ignore-able or not across the
business logic.

CORL-409

* Set the ignoreable optimisticResponse on comment mutations

We have set the ignoreable value in the graphQL schema, so now
the optimisticResponses are looking for a default value to use
until the data result arrives. Put to false since the ignoreable
value is set on our author, we likely don't want to ignore ourselves.

astropy,Mihai Cara,2014-08-04 09:57:48+00:00,"Performance and stability improvements to wcs.all_world2pix - 2nd iteration

This PR is a second iteration of PR #2373 with the main difference that
now the changes are on a branch (instead of master), hopefully does not
have (yet) merge conflicts, and addresses the issue of failing doctests
from PR #2373 by using data file name relative to the package as done
in PR #2807 and with updated output of the examples.

This (and #2373) provides significant improvements to the performance
(typically 1000-2000 times faster) and stability of `wcs.all_world2pix`
function. The used algorithm is a completely vectorized implementation
of the method of consecutive approximations (fixed point iterations).
While this method is a low-order method, it is more than adequate for
geometric distortions that are typical in astrophysical images (smooth,
slowly varying polynomials).

Compared to the original implementation of `all_world2pix`, this
implementation does not require users to have SciPy installed in order
to run.

While there is a check to see if WCS contains higher-order distortions
(and return the exact solution if it does not), the method itself does
not *require* this check and will converge to the exact solution after
one iteration if WCS does not contain higher order distortions. This
check is mostly for performance purposes to avoid unnecessary iterative
solution for images that do not contain distortions (and pix->sky
requires only WCS-based, i.e., CD-only transformations).

The proposed replacement for the current implementation of
`all_world2pix` avoids unnecessary use of `wcs_world2pix` and
`all_pix2world` such as `wcs_world2pix(all_pix2world(pix))` by
replacing this with `pix2foc`. This avoids unnecessary CD-matrix based
transformation CD(CD^{-1})=I which in itself results in about 50%
performance improvement over `wcs_world2pix(all_pix2world(pix))` and
likely 25% over `all_pix2world` alone.

The function has additional code to check for *divergence* condition
(as opposite to *slow convergence*) when consecutive approximations
*diverge*. This can happen when the pixel coordinates are *far* away
from the reference pixel (distortions are ""severely"" extrapolated), or
for poorly-defined geometric distortions (at least for this numerical
method).

A new and improved `NoConvergence` exception has attributes that allows
users to retrieve best solution reached by the function, and indices of
*slowly converging* solutions (points) that *did not converge* in the
specified maximum number of iterations as well as indices of
*diverging* solutions (likely an indication of poorly described
distortions or very large distortions).

Finally, the new test function `test_all_world2pix_direct` (proposed as
a replacement to the old test) provides a much more improved
(versatile) and *thorough* test of the `all_world2pix` function.

These improvements address the issues raised in #1977,
https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/3227 that plagued
`all_world2pix`, and #2294 (in addition to performance improvements).",https://github.com/astropy/astropy,794,2014-08-04 13:57:48+04:00,175.0,13.61533196440794,138,neutral,15.942028985507244

- Added new functions and classes for creating RGB images with independent scaling on each filter:
    * make_rgb(), make_log_rgb(), and make_linear_rgb() (convenience functions)
    * RGBImageMapping, a class for making RGB images using independent scaling on each band using the visualization interval and stretch functionality.
- Refactor lupton_rgb.py to use the visualization interval and stretch functionality:
    * Add RGBImageMappingLupton as a subclass of RGBImageMapping, with methods intensity() and apply_mappings() that implement the interconnected band scaling of Lupton et al. 2004.
    * Add AsinhLuptonStretch and AsinhZscaleLuptonStretch, subclasses of BaseStretch that implement the asinh and zscale asinh scalings of the existing lupton_rgb.py (with different functional form than the standard AsinhStretch).
    * Allow for input of an instance of a subclass of BaseStretch directly to make_lupton_rgb(), to allow for alternative stretches (eg, AsinhZscaleLuptonStretch)
- Added tests for log_linear_rgb.py
- Updated tests for lupton_rgb.py for the refactoring, and added coverage

The SwapJob creates temporary files indirectly through Tar.bz2.zip.
These files are deleted with File.deleteOnExit, but there is no other
deletion mechanism.  This means that temporary files will build up as
the git bridge runs, only being deleted when the JVM finally
terminates.

Instead, we can delete these temporary files as soon as they are no
longer needed.  The files are wrapped in a FileInputStream and not
directly exposed, so we can simply delete the underlying file when the
stream is closed, as then the file is inaccessible.",https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf,41,2017-07-14 10:08:50-01:00,10.0,18.01779603011636,60,neutral,25.0

Also various changes to make the CPU model less ISA dependent, which includes moving the code that checks for interrupts up to the ISA level, moving code that zeroes the zero registers up to the ISA level, and removing opcode and ra from the regfile.

arch/alpha/alpha_memory.cc:
    The regfile has been changed so it no longer has the opcode and ra.  Instead the xc holds the actual instruction, and from there the opcode and ra can be obtained with OPCODE() and RA().
arch/alpha/ev5.cc:
    Moved code that once existed within simpleCPU to ev5, and templatized it.
    This way the CPU models can call processInterrupts and the ISA specific interrupt handling is left to the ISA's code.
    Also moved ISA specific zero registers from simpleCPU to here.
arch/alpha/ev5.hh:
    Added macros for obtaining the opcode and ra from the instruction itself, as there is no longer opcode or ra in the regfile.
arch/alpha/isa_desc:
    Added in declarations for the FastCPU model.
arch/alpha/isa_traits.hh:
    Removed opcode and ra from the regfile.  The xc now holds the actual instruction, and the opcode and ra can be obtained through it.
    Also added the declaration for the templated zeroRegisters() function, which will set the zero registers to 0.
arch/isa_parser.py:
    Added in FastCPUExecContext so it will generate code for the FastCPU model as well.
cpu/exec_context.cc:
    Added in a more generic trap function so ""ev5_trap"" doesn't need to be called.  It currently still calls the old method, with plans for making this ISA dependent in the future.
cpu/exec_context.hh:
    Exec context now has the instruction within it.  Also added methods for exec context to read an instruction from memory, return the current instruction, and set the instruction if needed.
    Also has declaration for more generic trap() function.
cpu/simple_cpu/simple_cpu.cc:
    Removed references to opcode and ra, and instead sets the xc's instruction with the fetched instruction.

gem5,Gabor Dozsa,2015-07-16 00:53:50+00:00,"dev: add support for multi gem5 runs

Multi gem5 is an extension to gem5 to enable parallel simulation of a
distributed system (e.g. simulation of a pool of machines
connected by Ethernet links). A multi gem5 run consists of seperate gem5
processes running in parallel (potentially on different hosts/slots on
a cluster). Each gem5 process executes the simulation of a component of the
simulated distributed system (e.g. a multi-core board with an Ethernet NIC).

The patch implements the ""distributed"" Ethernet link device
(dev/src/multi_etherlink.[hh.cc]). This device will send/receive
(simulated) Ethernet packets to/from peer gem5 processes. The interface
to talk to the peer gem5 processes is defined in dev/src/multi_iface.hh and
in tcp_iface.hh.

There is also a central message server process (util/multi/tcp_server.[hh,cc])
which acts like an Ethernet switch and transfers messages among the gem5 peers.

A multi gem5 simulations can be kicked off by the util/multi/gem5-multi.sh
wrapper script.

Checkpoints are supported by multi-gem5. The checkpoint must be
initiated by a single gem5 process. E.g., the gem5 process with rank 0
can take a checkpoint from the bootscript just before it invokes
'mpirun' to launch an MPI test. The message server process will notify
all the other peer gem5 processes and make them take a checkpoint, too
(after completing a global synchronisation to ensure that there are no
inflight messages among gem5).",https://github.com/gem5/gem5,3379,2015-07-16 05:53:50+05:00,28.428571428571427,21.352498288843258,33,neutral,9.090909090909092

The multiply, floating point, and atomic memory instructions will be added

The loader is also modified to be able to parse RISC-V ELF files, and a
""Hello world\!"" example for RISC-V is added to test-progs.

Patch 2 will implement the multiply extension, RV64M; patch 3 will implement
the floating point (single- and double-precision) extensions, RV64FD;
patch 4 will implement the atomic memory instructions, RV64A, and patch 5
will add support for timing, minor, and detailed CPU models that is missing
from the first four patches (such as handling locked memory).

2. Add rv_type field into ExtMachInst
3. Split various constants into rv32/rv64 version
4. Fix mcause/mstatus/misa setting per rv_type
5. Split RiscvCPU into rv32/rv64
6. Fix how reset/branch create new pc so rv_type is preserved
7. Tag gdb-xml only for rv64

TODO:
Add rv32 gdb-xml
Add rv32 implementation into decoder

Currently there're three places where we store the rv_type information
(1) ISA (2) PCState (3) ExtMachInst. In theory, the ISA should be the
source of truth, and propagates information into PCState, then Inst.

However, there is an API on RiscvProcess that let users modify the
rv_type in PCState, so there's a chance to get inconsistent rv_type. We
should either modify the structure so such kind of usage is well
supported, or just prohibit people from setting a different rv_type.

This commit fixes the ""Need is_secure arg"" crash that occurs when
using the IndirectMemoryPrefetcher, SignaturePathPrefetcher,
SignaturePathPrefetcherV2, STeMSPrefetcher, and PIFPrefetcher. This
was done by changing some variables to be AssociativeSet<...>
instead of AssociativeCache<...> and changing the affected function
calls.
