The conversion is via the management command migrate-episode-actions and
should be carried out incrementally based on the Ids of the actions in the
relational backend (ids given with --min-id=<id> and --max-id=<id>).

As episode actions are never changed, the migration can catch up until it
reaches current items. If the backlog is small enough (eg a few thousand
objects), creation of new episode actions in the relational backend can
be stopped, all remaining objects migrated and the backend be switched to the
CouchDB based one (which still has to be implemented).",https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo,305,2010-11-23 06:33:39-02:00,16.4,15.268993839835728,771

Allows you to run `nix run .\#gen-proto` in order to generate `.pb.go`
files based on our `uniond/proto/` definitions. Does not require docker
images or Makefiles.


The generation process matches the `.pb.go` files we had before, except
for one difference:

```patch
diff --git a/uniond/x/union/types/query.pb.gw.go b/uniond/x/union/types/query.pb.gw.go
index 9b6e342..1cb4819 100644

-	pattern_Query_Params_0 = runtime.MustPattern(runtime.NewPattern(1, []int{2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1}, []string{""union"", ""params""}, """", runtime.AssumeColonVerbOpt(true)))
+	pattern_Query_Params_0 = runtime.MustPattern(runtime.NewPattern(1, []int{2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1}, []string{""union"", ""params""}, """", runtime.AssumeColonVerbOpt(false)))
 )
 
```

As you can see, we now have `runtime.AssumeColonVerbOpt(true)`. Judging
from the [grpc-ecosystem
docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/runtime#AssumeColonVerbOpt)
and [this description of what it does](https://namho46.tistory.com/18),
I assume that this is fine. I've also searched through the `juno` and
`cosmos-sdk` repos, and they have it set to `false` for every possible
field.

In addition to this, generated `.pb.go` are patched to include relevant
`staticcheck` ignore statements

This PR upgrade the prover to latest cometbft change in order to solve
an issue with the hash to field algorithm.
It also reintroduce an API call example for the prover and rename
`cometbls-prover` to `unionpd`.
We no longer have a duplicated `HashToField` but directly rely on the
cometbls implementation.

These will be changed in the sake of nixified protobuf generation later.

- Refactors the `Bundle` (formerly: `Bindir`). system. Bundles are now
fully immutable such that they can live in the `/nix/store`, and the
`bins/` directory no longer contains a `current` symlink.
- The `current` symlink is now instead handled by `Symlinker`, which
asserts validity of binaries in a bundle, and then creates a `current`
link in the `--root`, fully decoupled from the bundle itself.
- Bundles now contian a `meta.json`, which describes their structure. 
- We've decided to fully remove the `revert` system
- Since data in `config/` is also mutated by `uniond`, we now backup the
entire `home/` dir.
- Updates naming to avoid confusion between the _unionvisor root_ and
the _uniond home_. The former is now called `root` everywhere. (Prev. it
was called `home` in some cases)
- Various small fixes (typos such as ""monniker"")
- Adds `cargo-nextest` to the devShell
- Bumps workspace rust channel to `nightly-2023-05-16`
- Fixes `clippy::pedantic` warnings for the entire crate

This PR adds working connection and channel handshakes between cometbls
and ethereum, and basic one-way packet relaying from our wasm contract
to the evm.

Main features and additions:

- Generic `LightClient` interface, with two implementors `(Cometbls` and
`Ethereum`)
- `Connect<C: LightClient>`, with `Cometbls` and `Ethereum` both
implementing it for eachother
- ""Canonical"" types, used in the aforementioned interfaces, allowing for
one unified to be used in place of the generated ones (i.e.,
`protos::ibc::core::client::v1::Height` and `IbcCoreClientV1HeightData`,
both implementing Into/From `Height`)


There are also various small changes and fixes to both contracts that
were required during the process of this PR.",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,12856,2023-06-19 22:07:47+04:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,912

Note that while this PR may look quite large, it's 90% strict refactor;
the types and conversions previously defined in

Non-refactoring changes made:

- Deduplicated `Fraction` proto message definitions, both cometbls and

union,hussein-aitlahcen,2023-08-24 10:49:24+00:00,"test suite for yui-ibc contracts (#358)

**Note**: Originally included only the tests for IBCClient and
IBCConnection. I'm now working on sub PRs on top of this to write the
full test suite
At least until it's in a good-enough state, and reviewed by someone, so
it's ready to be merged

---

This starts a new test suite, where I'm going bottom-up:
* IBCClient is already tested. That one is relatively simple
* IBCClientHandler is a thin wrapper on top of the above, with only some
event emissions added, so trivial to test as well
* IBCConnection is where complexity starts creeping in. This requires
testing the connection handshake sub-protocol from ICS 003, and due to
lack of proper tests in the original, I'm having a harder time
reverse-engineering each individual param and how to properly mock each
msg.

Contracts to test:
- [x] IBCClient
- [x] IBCClientHandler
- [x] IBCConnection (closes #355)
- [x] IBCConnectionHandler
- [x] IBCChannelHandshake
- [x] IBCChannelHandler  
- [x] IBCPacket
- [ ] IBCPacketHandler  
- [ ] ... (will add more as I go)

- Updates cosmos-sdk ref to include epoch staking (resulted in
vendoring, please ignore those directories during the review).
- Added two e2e tests to ensure epoch staking is functioning correctly
on the union node.
- Added genesis overwrite parameters to
[`flake.nix:devnetConfig`](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/pull/462/files#diff-206b9ce276ab5971a2489d75eb1b12999d4bf3843b7988cbe8d687cfde61dea0R127-R139).
These overwrite parameters are used to configure the genesis to make
epoch staking easier to test.
> **NOTE**
> In the future, I'd like to make the genesis overwrite parameters
configurable on a per-test basis, but I'm considering that outside the
scope of this PR.

Updates the `Duration` and `Timestamp` types in unionlabs to be in line
with their proto specs.

TODO:

- [x] More tests for all conversions
- Added basic fuzzing (start of #409). We can look into using
[kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) as well.
- [x] Improve docs (these two types likely could use a module doc
explaining why they are the way they are)
- Copied some of the docs from the proto types; this can be expanded
upon in the future.

Lots of big changes! (Apologies for the 100k+ diff)

# Additions

- Move chain definitions into a standalone crate so they can be consumed
by hubble (eventually)

# Major changes (outside of voyager)

## `unionlabs`

- Make IBC message types generic over some of their field types (mainly
`Height`, `ClientId`, and `ClientType`)

- This allows for more type checking within the new relayer code -
instead of `MsgConnectionOpenTry`, you have the following:

    ```rust
    MsgConnectionOpenTry<
        ClientStateOf<L::HostChain>,
        L::ClientId,

This PR introduce the V2 of galois and it's circuit, it's a breaking
change for the light clients as we shrinked the public inputs from 7 to
5. The circuit has been drastically optimized through mimc hashing for
the validator set root, resulting in approximately 80% decrease in
constraints for the mainnet circuit (can be ran on a laptop now).

- Updated starlight version introduces `<Code />` component which lets
us use the same syntax theme as the rest of the docs. Currently the
theme is different when using our custom [`<EmbeddedSnippet
/>`](https://union.build/docs/integration/solidity/) vs. directly adding
code to markdown. With this update they're the same.
- Remove anchor tag reset in docs. Links are hard to distinguish from
real text in the docs when dark mode is on so underline fixes this
issue:

- Add `reset.d.ts` to `tsconfig.json` `files`. Previously it was not
being used since it wasn't listed there.

Adds `queue_msg::Reactor`, which runs the `queue_msg::QueueMsg` state
machine. This allows for the state machine to be used much more easily
outside of voyager's internals (see the `query ibc-path` command for an
example of this with `run_to_completion`) and will make integrating
block polling/ fetching with the queue state machine much easier.

- kept `unionlabs::TypeUrl`, so as to not have `prost::Name` in our

delegating to a prost generated type (this also does the typeurl

- remove `*EthAbi` traits, replace with `Encode/Decode<EthAbi>`
- extend `proto` attribute macro added in #1533 to a more generic
`model` macro that allows for ethabi as well as proto
- also does serde and standard derives (i.e. debug, clone, partialeq,
arbitrary)
- since it's an attribute macro we can also just use the derive's
attributes no problem (`#[serde]`, `#[debug]`, etc)
  - yes i totally planned this all along
- definitely not because attribute macros were 1 less feature for syn
that i've now enabled anyways for the custom debug derive
  - 😀
- general cleanup
- yeet `custom_debug_derive` in favour of our own in-house custom debug
derive
  - its better, trust me

- clean up dictionary
- allow for propagating fatal errors while handling a message, without
crashing voyager
  - this allows to handle unknown counterparty chains, for example
- this is done via `QueueError::Fatal`, which will write the stringified
error to the db and mark the message as failed, otherwise it will unwrap
and will be retried on reboot
- related, `GetChain::get_chain` now returns an option instead of
panicking
- clean up the update client message to only take the host client id,
and not the counterparty client id as well
- clients don't necessarily have a counterparty, and they track the
counterparty chain id in their client state, so all we need is the
client id of the client to be updated

- properly handle top-level data messages by running them to a fixed
point (noticed this once i started using `conc` more)

- there was a lot of copy-pasted code between union and cosmos in
voyager, this has been deduplicated now
- added helpers a la `Fetch::specific` to more tersely construct
`{LightClient,Chain}Specific{Data,Fetch,Aggregate}`, removing lots of
nested expressions and `.into()` calls
- union now uses `TrustedValidators` and `UntrustedValidators` instead
of just `Validators`, mirroring cosmos, so that the aggregation is not
dependant on the order of the data in the aggregation queue
- use `#[apply(msg_struct)]` in a few more places
- use more fully qualified paths in macros to reduce imports in files
they're called in
- use `id()` instead of `Identified::new()`
- should probably remove the `Identified::new` constructor at this
point, will do in a future PR

- add `scroll-rpc` crate, since `eth_getProof` is slightly different on
scroll and ethers can't handle it
- tbh im probably going to just use our own wrapper around the eth rpc
at this point, building off of this crate. we only need a small subset
of the api and if we plan to support more l2s/eth-ish chains down the
line, it will save a lot of headaches to have it all in-house and fully
customizable to our needs
- abstract a bit more between eth and scroll
- embrace the `BoxDynError``
- add boilerplate for `BatchHeader` which we might need down the line

# Optimizations
- Using custom and specific data types for all ics23 related stuff
including specs.
- Removed batch support.
- Inlined `doHashOp` to support only `SHA256`.
- Inlined `doLengthOp` to support only `VAR_PROTO`.
- Removed spec compatibility checks regarding `hashOp` and `lengthOp`
since we force them to be `SHA256` and `VAR_PROTO` now.
- Inlined chained membership verification for loop.
- Inlined all the common parts in specs.

# Test improvements
- Use `vm.pauseGasMeasurement()` and `vm.resumeGasMeasurement()` to only
measure what's needed.

# Results

Seems like depending on the data, the improvements are around 40%.

closes #1673

After some internal discussion, I think it's best to keep this module in
`unionlabs`, to avoid over-fragmenting our codebase; however the module
rename is still good.

- `unionlabs::proof` -> `unionlabs::ics24`
- added the remaining paths (receipts and next sequence paths)
- implementations in `chain_utils::ethereum` are stubbed out for now,
until #1663 is resolved
- simple proc macro for generating the `Display` and `FromStr`
implementations
  - much nicer to look at the module now lol
  - also one less use site of `derive_more`
- removed the `Path` suffix from the `Path` enum variants
- `IbcPath::Output` -> `IbcPath::Value`
- `Output` is just my default associated type name, `Value` is clearer

- made `IbcClientError<T>` more usable, and it is now used as the error
return type for all of the fallible methods on `IbcClient`
  - `<T as IbcClient>::Error` now must impl `Into<IbcClientError<T>>`

In this PR we remove the `sourcePort` from the public interface of
modules and instead recompute it in the IBC handler as `sourcePort =
hex(msg.sender)`.
We were no longer supporting arbitrary port and instead forced the port
to be the caller address, hex encoded.

Note that this breaks the IBC handler API (for solidity modules,
`sendPacket/writeAck` no longer require a port) and the UCS01/UCS02
protocols where `send` no longer require the local port.

It also changes the UCS01 `send`, where the timeoutHeight is now an
IBCHeight and an extra timeoutTimestamp parameter has been added",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,-219,2024-05-07 11:14:05-02:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,282

#1436  was merged despite the test it added not actually being ran by CI
This has prevented the CI test suit from running completely since.

This didn't trigger the workflow to have a non-zero exit code as the
eval commands were spawned asynchronously. Their stderr and exit codes
were disregarded while what did stream from their stdout was captured by
files used to continue the rest of the workflow.

These commands in unionlabs/workflows should be ran in a way that their
exit status is reflected in the parent and the currently failing test
that are in main should be fixed.

## Consequences of Intermediate Go Module

The introduction of the go module will lead to tech debt that will need
to be resolved once async ack is introduced into a released version of
cosmwasm.

Once async ack is made available, we'll need to:
1) Upgrade the contract to no longer use the go module and instead use
async ack
2) Upgrade the node to remove the intermediate module",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,6731,2024-06-06 04:12:15-03:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,158

Added `<Precise />` component. It utilizes the `asset` from balance
queries and `supportedAsset` from chain.assets (considered the source of
truth, while `asset` contains the balance).

To retrieve asset information from the chain, use `getSupportedAsset` in
helpers.ts.
### Usage:

`<Precise asset={asset} supportedAsset={supportedAsset} showSymbol
showToolTip />`

Display symbol using `showSymbol`
Show tooltip using `showToolTip`


#### _Toggle for unsupported_

This pr also handles show/hide unsupported assets using
`$showUnsupported` and a toggle under wallets.

- voyager dumped a client message yesterday due to an issue with the
ethereum lightclient update fetching logic (the slot didn't have enough
signatures yet)
- sentinel was running all night, causing the voyager queue to grow to
be very large (~6k messages)
- after requeuing the update message such that voyager could catch up
and start submitting packet messages again, we noticed the queue was
bricking and not progressing at all
- after far too long debugging, the *main* culprit was that ""historical""
`eth_getProof` requests (on blocks < 20 hrs old) were taking upwards of
1-2 minutes to get a response
- this broke several things, sqlx wasn't happy with the long postgres
transactions and would randomly not be able to find any more db
connections (thus crashing voyager), and we did hit deadlocks many times
in voyager as well which i believe came from ethers (we randomly hit
deadlocks in voyager sometimes and we don't know the cause)
- the queue was also unable to progress due to all of the messages at
the top of the queue requiring `eth_getProof`
- we tried out different rpc providers, thankfully alchemy was able to
provide these eth_getProof requests quickly (~100-200ms), so we switched
to alchemy for the sepolia execution rpc
- an additional fix was to no block the message handling on waiting for
a signer, so that other messages can progress (block fetching, other
transaction submission, dumping timeout messages if a packet has been
submitted, etc) - this saw a significant increase in throughput",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,88,2024-06-23 04:07:46+04:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,327

I've tested app.union.build in 10 different evm mobile wallets and only
in 1 of them I'm able to connect

the wallets I tested:

coinbase,
metamask,
trust wallet,
zerion,
rainbow,
1inch,
family,
phantom

in all but phantom it's not possible to trigger a connection or connect
at all,
in 2 of them it auto-connected without prompt and the button is hidden
(family & zerion)

in this pr,
I tested all the above mobile wallets in addition to on mac: firefox,
safari, chrome, edge, brave, arc.
Works in all cases

There is likely some more use cases or small issues that we're not aware
of atm that should still be fixed but in all current app.union.build is
unusable inside any app browser including popular ones like metamask",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,-14,2024-06-28 13:16:06-02:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,2606

union,Connor Davis,2024-07-02 14:16:06+00:00,"feat(ci): introduce new release workflow (#2159)

> The Union mono-repo is made up of many different components that are
maintained and updated at different rates. We've opted to release
components individually rather than in all encompassing versions. To do
this, version tags are to now be made in the form of
`<component>-<semantic_version>` (`voyager-v0.2.1`). This will enable us
to quickly update and distribute various components without creating
monolithic releases.
> 
> Once a tag in the form of `<component>-<semantic_version>` is pushed
to the repo, the component in question will have a release triggered for
it from the ""Release Component"" workflow.
> 
> **NOTE**: The Release Component workflow needs to be updated to
introduce new components. See the workflow file in
`.github/workflows/release-component.yml` for more details.

Sample releases:
- [Voyager
0.1.0](https://github.com/unionlabs/voyager/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
- [uniond-release
test](https://github.com/unionlabs/uniond-release/releases/tag/test)

This effectively deprecates the previous release workflow, though we
will keep it around as a fallback for now.

The new workflow can be triggered by pushing tags in the form of
`<component>-<semantic_version>`. Currently the following products are
supported by the Release Component workflow:
-
[unionlabs/unionvisor-bundles](https://github.com/unionlabs/unionvisor-bundles)

Towards #2659 (we need to implement the second half on cosmwasm)

In this PR:

- we implements a Cosmos in Cosmos light client in EVM that will allow
any cosmos chain connected to union to have it's root hash committed on
EVM. This will allow direct connections/channels to EVM through Union.
- we extend the `ILightClient` interface to expose `isFrozen` for light
clients.
- we fix a Cometbls light client bug where we weren't checking whether
the client was frozen or not before checking membership proofs.
- we simplify the UCS01 contract and improve some tests (fuzz edge case

The refactors significantly reduce code duplication, and improve
consistency throughout the app by re-using components where possible. It
also makes heavy use of GraphQL fragments to increase type safety.

# Plugins and Modules

## Changes

- unique errors for connection and client state verification in
ibc-solidity connection handshake verification
- more attributes on generated prost types for `cometbft-rpc`
- more canonical types in `unionlabs` for generated prost types
- the great untyping:
- `beacon-api-client` is now fully generic over chain spec and does not
take a generic for chain spec
- `unionlabs::ics24::Path` is no longer generic, using only concrete
types
- `unionlabs::ics24::IbcPath` is no longer generic, using only concrete
types
- IbcPath::Value for client and consensus state paths are now just
opaque bytes
- `unionlabs::event::IbcEvent` is no longer generic, using only concrete
types
- all of the IBC `Msg*` are no longer generic, using only concrete types
- added `Unbounded*` versions of all of the types in
`unionlabs::ethereum::beacon` that are generic over ChainSpec, for use
in `beacon-api-client`
    - open to better naming here
- `unionlabs::QueryHeight` is no longer generic, using only the concrete
type `Height`
- removed a bunch of old commented out code
- queue_msg:
- removed `OpEvent`/`QueueMessage::Event` (no longer useful with the new
architecture)
- added new `RawAny` type, since some cosmos types use a dynamic list of
`Any` values and as such they must be type-erased
- cleaned up `unionlabs::ethereum::beacon` to follow the structure of
the rest of the crate (one module/file per type)
- `#[model]` now derives `Eq`
- a lot of other stuff I'm too lazy to write out

## Closes

- https://github.com/unionlabs/union/issues/1813 (no longer relevant)

## Non-code refactors

- normalize comments in rust code (mostly affected generated code)

union,ben,2024-09-23 16:18:10+00:00,"feat: use new hash types across the workspace (#2984)

fully migrates all of our hash types to the new `Hash<BYTES, E>` type.

most of the diff is adding `::new` and `<>`. the changes in `ssz/` can
be largely ignored, as this is generated code.

this will also allow us to deprecate/ remove a lot of logic we have in
`serde-utils`.

some notes:

- `Hash::get` returns `&[u8; BYTES]`; if we deem this to be too
unergonomic we can change it to returning a copy instead.
- due to issues with how defaults affect type inference, we need to
provide the type as `<TYPE>` instead of just `TYPE` in some places. if
you're curious about why dm me, its too dark to explain here

future work:

- pull this type into it's own crate
- add a similar type for `Vec<u8>`",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,4,2024-09-23 15:18:10-01:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,327

- removed types on `VoyagerMessage` and `Call`/`Data`/`Callback`
- due to this change, i have removed `frunk` and all of the type level
hackery in `voyager-vm`. we have strayed too far from the light of god
for this to be useful anymore
- added docs to `voyager-vm`
- added more docs to `voyager`
- renamed variables of type `Op` named `msg` to `op` across the repo for
consistency
- implemented parent id tracking in `pg-queue`
- removed the pre-enqueue pass in favor of a ""filter""
(`pre_reenqueue_passes: &'a O` -> `filter: &'a T::Filter`), this
massively improved performance of the filtering
- `/msg` -> `/enqueue`
  - removed `/msgs` bc i don't think i ever even used it
- cleaned up `voyager-vm` a bit, mainly splitting the massive lib.rs
into modules
- clean up voyager cli and add some more useful commands
  - remove `voy-send-msg` as the cli now has a command for this",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,-609,2024-10-07 21:45:22+04:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,327

union,ben,2024-10-20 18:07:57+00:00,"feat: split cometbls light client types out from unionlabs (#3124)

- introduced `cometbls-light-client-types`
- i put this under `light-clients/cometbls-light-client/types` for now,
but we can pretty trivially move this down the line when we do
https://github.com/unionlabs/union/issues/2997
- also introduced a new `ChainId` type in this library to enforce the
length invariant on cometbls chain ids, allowing us to remove several
duplicated checks in various places.
  - used `alloy::sol!` for ethabi spec here instead of `ethers`
- slightly changed the constructor and error type of the `Bounded*`
types to make conversion much easier
- introduced `new_const` constructor for use in const contexts, this
functions exactly the same as the old `new` constructor
- small change to `required!`, it now requires that the error type impls
`From<MissingField>`
- as such, derived `thiserror::Error` for some final remaining error
types
- introduced `impl_proto_via_try_from_into!`
- i want to eventually remove `macros::model`, since it doesn't quite
work across many crates as well as it does when its designed for one
crate (`unionlabs`). This covers the same boilerplate as the `#[model]`
macro, but as a declarative macro.
- `unionlabs::hash::Hash<N>` <->
`alloy::core::primitives::FixedBytes<N>`
- remove logic inside of `canonicalize_stored_header` as this logic is
no longer needed with the new evm ibc stack
- i would remove it completely, but thats a larger change that should be
done as we migrate each light client. it currently just passes through
the original value, which is fine since the evm light clients don't even
work right now anyways 😁
- cleaned up clippy warnings across the repo, they were driving me
insane. i'll fix the clippy ci job later",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,242,2024-10-20 22:07:57+04:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,327

- connection and channel id are now just u32
- both have `from_str_prefixed` constructors, as well as alternate
display formatting (via `{:#}`) and a `to_string_prefixed` method to
emulate the old behaviour
- port id is as per the ics24 specification (same as it was previously,
but no longer using `Validated`)
- client id is now a tuple of (prefix, id)
- note that it is *not* client type as the prefix, as that is not
necessarily true - see `08-wasm`
- added alternate display formatting to `Height` to always display the
revision number, even if it's zero
- a bit of hacking on `#[ibc_path]`, this will be deprecated soon so
don't look too hard at it
- disabled some voyager commands temporarily, they will be re-enabled

- rename `IbcVersionId` to `IbcSpecId` as this type no longer represents
an IBC *version*, but rather the entire specification
- clean up `ibc-solidity`, removing unused definitions and moving some
that are only used in one place into said place where they're used. this
crate now only defines the IBC stack itself, so the `ibc` module was
also inlined
- split IBC spec definitions out of `voyager-message` into their own
crates
- these crates define the interface of the individual IBC interfaces;
there are still some rough edges but this is a good start
- remove `ics24` module from `unionlabs` and move those store path
definitions into the relevant IBC spec libraries
  - TODO: move `unionlabs::id` as well
- `union-ibc` now depends on `voyager-core`. i'm not super happy about
this, but it's fine for now - i'm still working on the library design
for the IBC specs, but i will likely split them further such that
`union-ibc` can only depend on the parts it needs.",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,-210,2024-12-06 18:12:09+05:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,327

union,cor,2025-01-09 10:35:40+00:00,"refactor(app): changes to stores (#3451)

Since the stores rely on rawIntents, propagated values can be undefined.
However, when validation is valid, we know all values are correct and
available. We could of course work with default values to never have
source and destination undefined. Selected asset, receiver and amount
cant be set to a default value tho.

so now we have

```js
export type FieldErrors = Partial<Record<keyof FormFields, string>>

export interface ValidTransfer {
  sourceChain: Chain
  destinationChain: Chain
  asset: {
    address: string
    balance: bigint
    symbol: string
    decimals: number
    gasToken: boolean
    supported: ChainAsset
  }
  receiver: string
  amount: string
}

export interface InvalidValidationStore {
  transfer: undefined
  errors: FieldErrors
  isValid: false
}

export interface ValidValidationStore {
  transfer: ValidTransfer
  errors: FieldErrors
  isValid: true
}

export type ValidationStore = InvalidValidationStore | ValidValidationStore
```

this gives us access to validated data for the transfer

### Example

```js
const transfer = async () => {
  if (!$validation.isValid) return
  let parsedAmount = parseUnits($validation.transfer.amount, $validation.transfer.asset.decimals)
}
```

We can take this further and include balance and sender etc. Not sure we
need valibot with this store tbh.",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,112,2025-01-09 09:35:40-01:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,2606

Intended behaviour:
1. `transfer`:
a. **Minter is TF, sent wrapped token**: Call
`TokenFactoryMsg::BurnFrom` -> tf minter checks whether the funds are
provided and burns.
b. **Minter is CW20, sent wrapped token**: Call
`TokenFactoryMsg::BurnFrom` -> cw20 minter just burns the tokens.
c. **Minter is TF, sent native token**: Call `LocalTokenMsg::TakeFunds`
-> tf minter checks whether the funds are provided and noops.
d. **Minter is CW20, sent CW20**: Call `LocalTokenMsg::TakeFunds` ->
cw20 minter calls `CW20::TransferFrom`
e. **Minter is CW20, sent native token**: Call
`LocalTokenMsg::TakeFunds` -> cw20 minter sees funds are provided, saves
the given `denom` as native and noops.

2. `recv_transfer`:
a. **Minter is TF**: Nothing fancy, just delegate the messages to `TF`.
    b. **Minter is CW20, need to create a wrapped token**:
1. Call `TokenFactoryMsg::CreateDenom`: Since `CW20` doesn't have the
token info yet, it just noops.
2. Call `TokenFactoryMsg::SetDenomMetadata`: `CW20` now has the token
info, so it instantiates a contract. To save the denom to the denom to
addr mapping, it saves the denom to `DENOM_TO_BE_STORED`. NOTE THAT THIS
IS A SINGLE VALUE STORAGE.
3. Step 2 results in `reply` if success, in the reply, read
`DENOM_TO_BE_STORED` and save denom and addr to `DENOM_TO_ADDR` mapping.
4. Call `TokenFactoryMsg::MintTokens`: Read from `DENOM_TO_ADDR` mapping
and mint the tokens.

c. **Minter is CW20, need to unescrow local token**: CW20 just calls
`CW20::Transfer`
d. **Minter is CW20, need to unescrow native token**: CW20 sees that the
given denom previously been saved as a native token. So it calls
`BankMsg::Send`.",https://github.com/unionlabs/union,893,2025-01-31 13:27:02-03:00,0.0,1.8809034907597535,158

- Add decimals to `FungibleAssetOrder` and make it V1.
- `move` implementation dropped support for `FungibleAssetOrderV0`.
- `cosmwasm` and `evm` implementations are backwards compatible with
`FungibleAssetOrderV0`.
- All implementations now default to `FungibleAssetOrderV1` in their
`transfer` function.

in `cw20`.

This small patch fixes a logical error in gradio_app.py, causing the generated HTML to contain the filepath relative to app root rather than relative to /static/. Before the patch, the generated `iframe_tag` would contain incorrect references such as `/static/./gradio_cache/5/white_mesh.html`.

deep-research,Wow Rakibul,2025-02-08 20:28:23+00:00,"Enhance text-splitter.test.ts with better coverage and maintainability

## Problem
The current test file for the text splitter (`src/ai/text-splitter.test.ts`) had several limitations:
- Lacked comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- Had repeated code setup in multiple test cases
- Missing explanatory comments for test scenarios
- Limited assertion coverage for boundary conditions

## Changes Made
1. **Improved Test Coverage:**
   - Added new test cases for special characters and large texts
   - Added boundary condition tests for chunkSize and chunkOverlap
   - Enhanced existing test cases with more assertions

2. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Extracted common setup code into `beforeEach` block
   - Improved variable naming for better clarity
   - Added descriptive comments explaining test scenarios

3. **Better Error Handling:**
   - Added explicit test for invalid configuration (chunkSize equal to chunkOverlap)
   - Enhanced assertion messages for better debugging

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- New test cases validate edge scenarios
- Boundary conditions are properly tested

WordCram,Dan Bernier,2012-06-26 18:24:00+00:00,"Make BBTree.setLocation faster.

Each BBTree was tracking its own copy of rootX and rootY; setLocation
would recurse through the tree, setting each BBTree instance's copies.
This was slow, and probably wasted a chunk of memory, too. Instead, give
each BBTree a reference to its parent, so we can recurse up the tree,
and get the root BBTree's rootX & rootY. This is probably slower when we
read the rootX & rootY, but faster when we setLocation (which we do a lot).

I originally tried giving each BBTree a reference directly to its root,
but because BBTreeBuilder builds bottom-up, the parent BBTree doesn't have
its root, at the point where it needs to pass it to its kids. There's maybe
some better way to do that, but this is pretty good for now.",https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram,3,2012-06-26 22:24:00+04:00,34.0,6.595482546201232,288

fastcache,Francis Stephens,2019-06-11 20:51:40+00:00,"Fix generation overflow (#17)

* Demonstrate Set/Get failure at 2^24 generations

There are only 24 bits available to carry the generation info in the
index map. When a bucket's generation is greater than 2^24 (16,777,216)
values added to the cache cannot be read from the cache at all.

* Read bucket generation as 24 bit value

If we always read a bucket's generation as a 24 bit value then the
generation value added to an element's index can continue to be compared
after generation overlows 24 bits.

* Added extra failing check to generation test

When a value is added with the max value for 24 bits, the next
generation bump will overflow generation ending up with a new 24 bit
generation value of 1.

This leaves the value with the max-24 generation with a generation that
satisfies none of the checks for Get. So elements of this generation
become unreadable.

* Checking for case where gen overflows in Get

If a value exists in the cache with the maximum value for 24 bits, the
next generation bump will give a generation value of 1.

generation is 1.",https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/fastcache,108,2019-06-11 17:51:40-03:00,31.5,5.002053388090349,1
